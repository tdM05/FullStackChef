# Principles of Universal Design
1. ### Equitable Use
   **Features we could implement**
    - Adding a multilingual support feature for users who speak different languages.
    - Allow users to change the font size for users whose vision is impaired.

   **Features that are implemented**
    - People of any diet can use our app since it allows users
   to search for any ingredient that exists in the spoonacular api.

2. ### Flexibility in Use
   **Features we could implement**
    - Allow different search recipe by ingredient formats 
   since currently, it forces the user to use a comma-separated list.
    - Implement a feature that allows users to customize the app's interface.
   
   **Features that are implemented**
    - Users can look for recipes in a variety of ways; searching by ingredients,
   searching through their history, or searching through their favorites.
3. ### Simple and Intuitive to Use
   **Features we could implement**
    - Introducing a drag-and-drop interface for easier meal planning.
    - Adding context-sensitive help and tips throughout the app.

   **Features that are implemented**
    - Simple and intuitive because our app user interface resembles programs that users
   are likely to be familiar with. For example, our search bar is similar to the google 
   search bar, and when displaying recipes, it is similar to how YouTube displays videos.
4. ### Perceptible Information
   **Features we could implement**
    - Integrating visual cues to confirm that the user clicked on a button. For
   example, when the user clicks generate grocery list again, it would be nice
   if a visual queue could alert them that their previous grocery list has been overwritten.
    - Then assuming visual cues where implemented, we could
   offer options to adjust the volume of the audio.

5. ### Tolerance for Error
   **Features we could implement**
    - Implementing a feature that allows users to undo generating a meal plan, reverting
   the meal plan that was generated before.

   **Features that are implemented**
    - The search ingredients feature allows users to have different space values between
    the ingredients that they typed, and allows slight typos.
    - A user history feature that keeps track of past recipes in case the user forgets what they have searched for.

6. ### Low Physical Effort
   **Features we could implement**
    - Introducing a select feature so the user can select multiple recipes at once
   to add to favorites.
    - Adding predictive text to include contextual suggestions when the user
   is entering ingredients.

   **Features that are implemented**
    - The app is designed to be used on a computer, which requires low physical effort.
    - The user only needs to type in the ingredients they have, and the app will do the rest.
7. ### Size and Space for Approach and Use ###
   This does not apply since our app takes up no physical space. Dealing with this is
the responsibility of the user's device.

# Target Audience

Our program is marketed towards busy people who still want to cook.
This group includes working professionals, parents juggling multiple responsibilities, 
and students living on their own for the first time.
By offering a user-friendly interface and personalized meal planning features, the app can save time and reduce the 
stress of figuring out what to cook every day and the stress of making
sure the ingredient they are looking for is in the recipe.

# Demographics less likely to use our app
1. **People who don't cook**: Our app is designed for people who cook, 
so people who don't cook are less likely to use it.
3. **People who cannot use a computer**: Our app is designed to be used on a computer so anyone
who cannot use a computer, including people with visual imparement, people with physical disabilities, 
and people who are not familiar with computers, are less likely to use our app.
