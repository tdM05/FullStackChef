# Full Stack Chef

## Software Specification
The program allows users to input the ingredients they currently have, 
receive recipe suggestions, create weekly meal plans, and generate
grocery lists. It supports dietary needs, including both preferences 
(e.g., vegan, keto) and restrictions (e.g., gluten-free, dairy-free), 
and provides basic nutritional information for each recipe. 
Additionally, users can leave reviews and ratings for recipes they 
try and view top-rated recipes based on community feedback.
